# Unity Framework
The unity framework project is a project that can be used whenever starting a new project.  It allows us to quickly get our basic framework and structure set up instantly, as well as a place to put our re-useable scripts for use in later projects.

Also included is the basic structure scenes should follow when being built.  These can be found in the [Scenes](https://github.com/Gizmmo/UnityFramework/tree/master/Assets/Scenes) folder.

##How to use
If you just want to use the standard package and not make any additions to the framework, check out the latest release in the [Releases](https://github.com/Gizmmo/UnityFramework/releases) page.  Follow these steps:
- Download latest version of .unitypackage release
- Drag into wanted projects
- Select all folders
- Import

If you want to make additions to the project before, do the following:
- Download the source code
- Make the wanted changes
- Export the Assets folder as a Unity Package
- Import that package into your actual game
- Send a pull request in for your changes! (please?)
